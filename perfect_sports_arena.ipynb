    "In the Nation Basketball Association (NBA), the arenas that each team plays in typically are located in the downtown of the city. As a fan of the NBA and more specifically the San Antonio Spurs, I enjoy going to games in person since I live in the same city. The AT&T Center is the name of the arena that the San Antonio Spurs play in. However, unlike other arenas for other teams in the league, the AT&T center is not even located in downtown San Antonio. It is located approximately 5 miles from downtown. The question then becomes: Would it make more sense to have a sports arena that is located downtown as opposed to its current location. "

    "For this report I will use San Antonio location data to visualize the neighborhood and venue densities of both the area surrounding the AT&T Center and downtown San Antonio. If downtown is more densely populated with neighborhoods and venues, then that could lead to an economic incentive to have an arena in that area."
